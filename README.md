# CloudIDE-Project

🚀 Just Built: A Real-Time Collaborative Cloud IDE with Video/Audio Calling + YouTube Live Streaming Support! 🎥💻

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a full-stack project that solves a real-world pain point — especially for educators, interviewers, and remote developer teams.
I'm excited to finally share it:

🛠️ What I built:
A Cloud IDE that brings together everything you need to teach, code, collaborate, and even go live — all in one platform.

🌟 Key Features
✅ Live Video/Audio Calls using WebRTC — communicate instantly with team members
✅ YouTube Live Streaming powered by FFmpeg — stream your coding sessions or classes in real-time
✅ Real-Time Code Collaboration via CRDT (Yjs) — no need for Google Docs + Zoom + VS Code + OBS
✅ Built using MERN Stack + Django/Flask knowledge
✅ Seamless, all-in-one experience — no context switching!

🎯 Why this matters:
Many educators and teams juggle between different tools — Zoom for meetings, VS Code Live Share for coding, OBS for streaming.
This project aims to streamline that experience, making it easier to collaborate, code, and teach — from anywhere.

👨‍💻 Tech Stack Highlights

React + Node.js + Express + MongoDB
WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication
FFmpeg integration for streaming to YouTube
Yjs (CRDT) for real-time multi-user editing
Scalable, modular, and production-ready architecture

💡 Whether you're an educator hosting live coding classes, a team conducting interviews or peer programming, or just someone who values seamless collaboration, this platform is built with you in mind.
🔗 I’d love to connect with fellow devs, educators, or startups who are solving similar problems or want to take this idea further.
